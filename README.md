# Quantum Connectome Characterization

This repository focuses on the characterization of quantum connectomes using data collected from Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Personal Omics data. The project integrates advanced computational models to simulate and analyze neural networks through the lens of quantum mechanics and graph theory.

## Overview

The **Quantum Connectome Characterization** project develops a personalized quantum model of the human connectome. By incorporating real-time BCI data and omics profiles, this framework aims to bridge quantum computational methods with neuroscience to simulate neural dynamics at an unprecedented level of detail.

### Key Objectives:
1. Process and integrate BCI and personal omics data for connectome calibration.
2. Characterize neural connections using eigenvalues, harmonics, and tensor networks.
3. Expand generic connectome models into personalized quantum connectomes.

## Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect BCI data using EEG or similar devices.
   - Preprocess raw data using transformer-based Large Mental Models (LMM) and Large Omics Models (LOM).
   - Clean and align omics data to identify key biomarkers and molecular pathways.

2. **Connectome Characterization**:
   - Develop a generic connectome model based on known human connectome architectures.
   - Use BCI and omics data to perturb and personalize the connectome.
   - Compute eigenvalues, harmonics, and hierarchical tensor networks to analyze neural dynamics.

3. **Connectome Expansion**:
   - Expand the generic connectome by integrating individual-specific data.
   - Generate quantum connectome Hamiltonians for further simulations.
